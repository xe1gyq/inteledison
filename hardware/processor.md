> Medfield is the follow-up of Moorestown, it combines two chip solution into one. Other than that it also added always-on and constant tsc and lapic timers. Medfield is the platform name, and the chip name is called Penwell we treat Medfield/Penwell as a variant of Moorestown. Penwell can be identified via MSRs.

> Intel MID is Intel's Low Power Intel Architecture \(LPIA\) based Mobile Internet Device \(MID\) platform. Unlike standard x86 PCs, Intel MID does not have many legacy devices nor standard legacy replacement devices/features. e.g. It does not contain i8259, i8254, HPET, legacy BIOS, most of the io ports.

> In March 2014, Intel announced changes in the Intel Edison project and the second version of the board was presented in September 2014. Its dimensions are 35.5 x 25 x 3.9 mm, with components on both sides. The board's main SoC is a 22 nm Intel Atom "Tangier" \(Z34XX\) that includes two Atom Silvermont cores running at 500 MHz ...

## Intel SIMD Extensions

> In computing, Streaming SIMD Extensions \(SSE\) is an SIMD instruction set extension to the x86 architecture, designed by Intel and introduced in 1999 in their Pentium III series processors as a reply to AMD's 3DNow!. SSE contains 70 new instructions, most of which work on single precision floating point data. [Wikipedia Intel SIMD Extensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions)

## Intel® 14 nm Technology

> Supporting a wide range of products from mobile devices to servers, 14 nm transistors improve performance and reduce leakage power. Intel® 14 nm technology will be used to manufacture a wide range of high-performance to low-power products including servers, personal computing devices, and products for the Internet of Things.
